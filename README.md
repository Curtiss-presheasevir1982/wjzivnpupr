Just stepped out of the theater and wow, my neck feels like I’ve been carrying a backpack full of disappointments. Popcorn crumbs are everywhere, like the aftermath of some crunchy little explosion. Anyway, DROP. DROP. Seriously, do movies even happen like this? There’s this scene, right, where water gushes down the staircase like someone left the shower on in heaven. Reminds me of my attempt at a home plumbing fix... chaos in 3, 2, 1.

— Can't tell if this guy next to me is talking about the movie or narrating his life. Dude's laugh sounds like a dying car engine. Oh! And the way the protagonist looks at the bird – I swear, it’s the same way I stare at my laptop waiting for code to compile. Pure longing with a splash of “why am I not anywhere else?”

> Someone should've warned me about the sound levels. My ears are ringing louder than my lost hopes at a science fair in middle school. Seriously, though, I gotta tell you, remember to download the movie because some scenes, you just need to pause and stare at like a piece of modern art in a busy street. Or was it watch the movie? My brain, like a deer in headlights.

And then there’s this whole sequence with the trees, almost felt like my code thrashing in production. Beautiful to watch, horrifying to endure. Has anyone ever seen a forest that feels so much like my social life? Overgrown yet eerily silent.

Anyway my back is killing me from those seats, like they designed them with the idea of turning humans into pretzels. But man, I can’t believe you haven’t seen it. Go on, download the movie, wait no, watch the movie – whatever gets it on your screen. It’s like tasting chocolate on Mars, uncanny but inevitable.
